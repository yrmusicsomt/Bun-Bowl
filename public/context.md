## 1. Overview

The Restaurant Website project is designed to showcase the restaurant’s information, menu, and services in a modern, user-friendly format. The site features a consistent design using the Outfit font, flexible use of images (sourced from the public folder), and clear navigation. Its primary focus is to provide information rather than facilitate online ordering.

## 2. Navigation & Layout

- **About:**  
  Section on the landing page with details about the restaurant's history, mission, and ambiance.

- **Menu:**  
  A section on the landing page that lists dishes categorized by type (e.g., Salad, Pho, Burger, etc.). Each category is interactive and toggles to show or hide its respective dishes.

- **Contact Us:**  
  Section on the landing page providing contact information such as phone, email, address, and possibly a contact form.

- **Delivery:**  
  A header link that redirects users to the Uber app (or website) for placing a delivery order. This is not a separate page.
